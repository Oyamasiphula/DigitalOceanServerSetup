# Select SSH Keys (Optional)

We can setup our SSH keys later when we're done creating Droplet and done connecting via the Terminal on our personal machines.

`Optional`: Select which SSH keys you would like to add to your new Droplet.

<p>It is recommended that you set up SSH keys to authenticate to your Droplets because it provides better security than a basic password.
